[DONE] HTML report covers all new artefact sections with summary cards
[DONE] Transcript logging (Start-Transcript)
[DONE] SHA256 hashing of all evidence files (chain of custody)
[DONE] Per-VM evidence separation (Evidence\<VmLabel>\)

[DONE] Browser artefacts (history, bookmarks, search queries, downloads)
[DONE] Volatile evidence (DNS cache, clipboard, mapped drives, RDP sessions)

[ ] RawCopy64.exe in bin\ - needed by Get-MFTAndUsnJournal to copy locked $MFT/$UsnJrnl
       Without it, the function falls back to shadow copy or skips. Get from:
       https://github.com/jschicht/RawCopy
[ ] Test full script run on a practice VM BEFORE crime scene day
       Run as admin, check all output folders populate, HTML report renders
[ ] Consider adding: VSS shadow copy browsing/file recovery
       (currently detects shadow copies but doesn't extract files from them)

========== DOCUMENTS TO SUBMIT (due 17 Apr) ==========

[ ] Evidence intake form + Chain of Custody paperwork
       - Must document every item seized, who handled it, timestamps

       - Downloaded files linked to extortion method
       - Copies on the volume
[ ] Hidden/suspicious mechanisms (20% of marks)
       - Check ADS, hidden files, encrypted volumes, timestomped files
       - Defender exclusions, firewall rule changes
       - WMI persistence, suspicious autoruns
       - Tool installations (VeraCrypt, wipers, etc.)
[ ] Memory/process links between VMs (20% of marks)
       - RAM dump analysis with Volatility 3
       - Network connections between VMs
       - RDP artefacts, shared drives
       - strings.exe on RAM dump for IPs, emails, URLs
[ ] Second VM investigation (20% of marks)
       - Sleeping VM -> image with FTK, then offline analysis
       - Registry hives, Amcache, MFT timeline
       - Evidence linking both VMs to same suspect
       - Evidence of the two charged offences
       - Identify responsible individual(s)

========== STANDARDS TO FOLLOW ==========
