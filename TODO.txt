TODO - Updated 20 Feb 2026
==========================

========== SCRIPT / TECHNICAL (for crime scene day, 28 Feb) ==========

[DONE] Multi-VM batch mode (run.bat menu + Invoke-MultiVMCollection + -BatchMode switch)
[DONE] Full event log export (Get-FullEventLogs - all .evtx + forensic Event ID triage)
[DONE] Registry hive collection (SAM, SYSTEM, SOFTWARE, SECURITY, NTUSER.DAT, UsrClass.dat)
[DONE] SRUM database collection (network usage, app execution)
[DONE] Amcache & ShimCache extraction (execution history)
[DONE] LNK files & Jump Lists (file access history)
[DONE] Thumbnail cache collection (viewed images/videos)
[DONE] MFT & USN Journal acquisition (file system timeline + deleted file recovery)
[DONE] $UsnJrnl:$J raw binary extraction (PowerForensics → esentutl fallback)
[DONE] Email artefact collection (Outlook PST/OST, Thunderbird, Windows Mail)
[DONE] Pagefile & hiberfil.sys acquisition (RAM fragments, hibernation memory)
[DONE] FTK Imager disk imaging integration (E01/RAW with verification)
[DONE] Sleeping VM artefact workflow (Get-SleepingVMArtefacts - VMDK imaging + notes)
[DONE] HTML report covers all artefact sections with summary cards
[DONE] Transcript logging (Start-Transcript)
[DONE] SHA256 hashing of all evidence files (chain of custody)
[DONE] Per-VM evidence separation (Evidence\<VmLabel>\)
[DONE] Anti-forensics detection (ADS, hidden files, encrypted volumes, timestomping)
[DONE] Browser artefacts (history, bookmarks, search queries, downloads)
[DONE] Firefox full support (places.sqlite: history, bookmarks, search queries)
[DONE] Raw bookmark JSON/SQLite file copying for offline analysis
[DONE] Volatile evidence (DNS cache, clipboard, mapped drives, RDP sessions)
[DONE] System info collection (OS, hostname, timezone, uptime, Secure Boot, DeviceGuard, BitLocker)
[DONE] Boot/Shutdown timeline in HTML report (Event IDs 6005/6006/6008/41/1074)
[DONE] Print CSS for HTML report (page-break-inside, forced open details)
[DONE] UTF-8 encoding on all CSV exports
[DONE] Error/collection summary at end of run (OK/Empty/FAILED counts)
[DONE] Removed dead Get-EventLogTriage function (replaced by Get-FullEventLogs)
[DONE] Fixed Format-Table pipeline corruption in early collection functions
[DONE] Fixed SuppressMessageAttribute placement in main.ps1
[DONE] Fixed Write-Output → Write-Host in main.ps1 header block
[DONE] PSScriptAnalyzer: $null comparisons, $input rename, $matches rename
[DONE] RawCopy no longer needed — PowerForensics + esentutl handle $MFT/$LogFile/$UsnJrnl

[ ] Test full script run on a practice VM BEFORE crime scene day
       Run as admin, check all output folders populate, HTML report renders
[ ] Consider adding: VSS shadow copy browsing/file recovery
       (currently detects shadow copies but doesn't extract files from them)

========== DOCUMENTS TO SUBMIT (due 17 Apr) ==========

[ ] Evidence intake form + Chain of Custody paperwork
       - Must document every item seized, who handled it, timestamps
       - Template should be in Week 4 module section on Canvas
[ ] Forensic report (on the provided template - yellow highlighted section)
       - Must include: PS1 scripts (commented/indented), transcript logs, HTML report output
       - Must cover exhibits for court
       - "No logs, no points" - make sure transcript + HTML are included
[ ] Expert witness report
       - First-person account of what you did
       - Expert opinion about the suspect
       - Professional, court-ready language
[ ] Contemporaneous notes
       - HANDWRITTEN with dates and times (unless SORA exemption agreed)
       - Scanned in for submission
       - Record everything: arrival time, what you saw, what you ran, observations

========== ANALYSIS TASKS (after crime scene, before submission) ==========

[ ] Evidence of extortion/theft (20% of marks)
       - Files or metadata exported from victims
       - Downloaded files linked to extortion method
       - Copies on the volume
[ ] Hidden/suspicious mechanisms (20% of marks)
       - Check ADS, hidden files, encrypted volumes, timestomped files
       - Defender exclusions, firewall rule changes
       - WMI persistence, suspicious autoruns
       - Tool installations (VeraCrypt, wipers, etc.)
[ ] Memory/process links between VMs (20% of marks)
       - RAM dump analysis with Volatility 3
       - Network connections between VMs
       - RDP artefacts, shared drives
       - strings.exe on RAM dump for IPs, emails, URLs
[ ] Second VM investigation (20% of marks)
       - Sleeping VM -> image with FTK, then offline analysis
       - Registry hives, Amcache, MFT timeline
       - Evidence linking both VMs to same suspect
       - Evidence of the two charged offences
       - Identify responsible individual(s)

========== STANDARDS TO FOLLOW ==========

- ACPO Good Practice Guidelines (4 principles)
- ISO 27037 (digital evidence identification, collection, acquisition, preservation)
- ISO 17025 (forensic lab competence)
- Forensic Science Regulator standards
