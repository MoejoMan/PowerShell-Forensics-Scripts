TODO

1. Multi-VM Evidence Collection & Separation
Your script is not automated for two VMs; you must run it separately for each VM and manually label outputs.
No batch or loop to collect from both VMs in one go.
No handling for sleeping/offline VMs (disk image extraction).

2. Sleeping VM Artefact Extraction
No code to mount/analyze sleeping VM disk images (e.g., VMDK).
No integration of FTK Imager or SimpleImager for offline artefact extraction.

3. Disk/MFT/NTFS Metadata Collection
No collection of $MFT, $LogFile, $UsnJrnl (critical for file system timeline and deleted file recovery).
No registry hive collection (SAM, SYSTEM, SOFTWARE, NTUSER.DAT, etc.).
No collection of pagefile.sys or hiberfil.sys (for memory artefacts).

4. Disk Imaging Integration
FTK Imager and SimpleImager are present, but not integrated into your main workflow.
No automated disk imaging step for sleeping VMs.

5. Artefact Completeness
Your script covers volatile and non-volatile artefacts (RAM, processes, users, network, downloads, browser history, etc.).
Missing:
Full event logs (not just triage/last 3 days).
Registry hives.
NTFS metadata.
Pagefile/hiberfil.
Email artefacts (if provided by victim).
Evidence of links between VMs (e.g., RDP, shared files, network connections).

6. Evidence Intake & Chain of Custody
Not relevant until you have physical evidence, but must be prepared for final submission.

7. Artefact Analysis
No automated analysis for:
Files/metadata related to extortion/theft.
Hidden/suspicious mechanisms.
Memory/process links between VMs.
Evidence of offences and responsible individuals.
You must manually review artefacts or add analysis steps.

Requirement (from brief)	Status	Notes
Evidence intake/chain of custody	Not needed yet	Prepare for final submission
Forensic report (template)	Missing	Must use provided template
Expert witness report	Missing	First-person account/opinion
Contemporaneous notes	Missing	Handwritten/scanned or digital
PS1 scripts & HTML report	Complete	Automated collection, but not full artefact set
Transcript logs	Complete	Audit trail present
Multi-VM automation	Missing	Manual per VM, no batch/loop
Sleeping VM artefact extraction	Missing	Needs disk imaging + offline artefact extraction
MFT/NTFS metadata	Missing	No $MFT, $LogFile, $UsnJrnl collection
Registry hives	Missing	No SYSTEM/SAM/SOFTWARE/NTUSER.DAT
Disk imaging integration	Missing	FTK Imager present, not integrated
Artefact completeness	Partial	No pagefile/hiberfil, registry, MFT
Artefact analysis	Missing	No automated analysis for links/extortion
Evidence separation	Partial	Label system, manual per VM
What you must do next (brief-driven):

Integrate disk imaging for sleeping VMs.
Add collection of MFT, registry hives, and other NTFS artefacts.
Ensure you run the script for both VMs and keep evidence separated.
Review artefacts for links, extortion evidence, and hidden mechanisms.
Complete forensic report (template), expert witness report, and contemporaneous notes.
